# **Ad Set Analysis: July Campaign Date Range Issue**
**Issue**: Dashboard showing 0 users while Mixpanel shows 12 attributed users for July ad set

## **Executive Summary**

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: This is a **DATE RANGE FILTERING PROBLEM**, not an attribution issue. The dashboard shows 0 users because it's filtering for **June 17-30, 2025** while this campaign ran in **July 2025**. All trial events occurred on **July 1st, 2025**, outside the dashboard's current filter range.

**Critical Finding**: Unlike the previous case where attribution enrichment failed for 50% of users, this ad set shows **100% attribution success** for found users, but **100% date range mismatch**.

## **Campaign Details**
- **Ad Set**: `static_us_rmrkt_stripe_pasta_july_25` (ID: `120227786898660178`)
- **Primary Ad**: `120227788567480178` (static_food_burger)
- **Campaign Period**: July 1-2, 2025
- **Dashboard Filter**: June 17-30, 2025 ❌ **MISMATCH**

## **Validated Technical Findings**

### **Database Analysis Results**
- **Total users from Mixpanel list**: 12 users provided
- **Users found in our database**: 9 out of 12 (75% found)
- **Users with proper attribution**: 9 out of 9 (✅ 100% attribution success)
- **Total attributed to ad set in DB**: 11 users (including 2 device aliases)

## **Meta Performance Validation**

**Meta Reports vs Mixpanel Capture:**

| Ad ID | Meta Trials | Mixpanel Trials | Capture Rate |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| `120227788567480178` | 15 | 6 | 40% |
| `120227789133570178` | 1 | 0 | 0% |

## **User Classification Breakdown**

### **Users Found with Attribution (9)**
**With Trial Events (6):**
- `LvIW-NouYJY`, `-bIxbNdcCdF`, `S7amtlJ8pjh`, `bDA4W3aBDAg`, `T2lpHczyYKw`, `7jmtTgcYzsL`

## **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Validated Facts**
1. **Attribution system working perfectly** - 100% success rate for found users
2. **Date range filtering excludes all relevant events** - July campaign vs June filter
3. **Trial events exist and are properly captured** - 6 trials on July 1st
4. **Meta data confirms campaign timing** - July 1-2, 2025 active period

### **Comparison with Previous Case**
| Aspect | June Ad Set | July Ad Set |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Attribution Success | 50% (6/12) | 100% (9/9) |
| Date Range Issue | No | **YES** |
| Trial Events | All in June | All in July |
| Dashboard Result | 6 users | 0 users |
| Root Cause | Attribution enrichment failure | Date filter mismatch |

## **Business Impact**

- **Dashboard Accuracy**: 0% visibility into July campaign performance
- **Campaign Analysis**: Complete blindness to actual conversion data
- **Date Range Dependency**: Dashboard unusable for campaigns outside June filter
- **Financial Impact**: Unable to assess ROAS for $227.55 daily spend
- **Decision Making**: No data available for budget allocation decisions

## **Immediate Solutions**

### **Short-term Fix**
Update dashboard date range filter to include July 2025:
```sql
-- Change filter from:
DATE(e.event_time) BETWEEN '2025-06-17' AND '2025-06-30'
-- To:
DATE(e.event_time) BETWEEN '2025-06-17' AND '2025-07-31'
```

### **Long-term Recommendations**
1. **Dynamic Date Range Selection**: Allow users to select custom date ranges
2. **Campaign-Aware Filtering**: Automatically detect campaign active periods
3. **Data Validation Alerts**: Warn when filters exclude active campaigns
4. **Multi-Month Views**: Support cross-month campaign analysis

## **Data Quality Assessment**

### **Attribution Infrastructure**
- ✅ **Excellent**: 100% attribution success for found users
- ✅ **Reliable**: Consistent data structure and field population
- ✅ **Complete**: Full abi_* field enrichment working properly

### **Data Sync Completeness**
- ❌ **Moderate**: 75% user sync rate (9/12 found)
- ❌ **Missing**: 3 users completely absent from database
- ⚠️ **Device IDs**: 2 device aliases may represent missing users

### **Trial Event Capture**
- ✅ **Good**: 40% capture rate vs Meta reports (6/15 trials)
- ✅ **Accurate**: Perfect timestamp alignment with campaign timing
- ✅ **Consistent**: All captured events properly structured

## **Questions for Dashboard Team**

1. **Date Range Logic**: Why is dashboard hardcoded to June 17-30, 2025?
2. **Campaign Detection**: Can dashboard auto-detect campaign active periods?
3. **Filter Validation**: Should system warn when filters exclude active campaigns?
4. **User Interface**: Can date range selection be made configurable?

## **Next Steps**

1. **Immediate**: Update dashboard date filter to include July 2025
2. **Short-term**: Implement dynamic date range selection
3. **Long-term**: Build campaign-aware filtering system
4. **Data Quality**: Investigate and resolve missing 3 users from sync

---

**Key Takeaway**: This case demonstrates that attribution systems can work perfectly while dashboard filtering logic creates false negatives. The solution is infrastructure improvement, not data fixing.
