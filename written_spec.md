Price Bucket Debug

This page is supposed to help debug the price bucket tool.
This page should be very simple, it should simply have a large table with four columns: - Product ID - Country - Price Bucket - Number of Users in that Bucket The whole idea is I should be able to filter each one or sort each one so I can sort by the country, I can sort by the product ID, whatever I want and it will filter the table accordingly. It should also provide me stats with how many users were properly sorted into a bucket. How many of them had to inherit? How many of them had to forward inherit? How many of them don't have a price bucket? How many of them have an error? How many of them have a default bucket? I basically want just a bunch of stats at the top of the screen above the big table. 
This should all be built as a component or a set of components in the same file, self-contained with the APIs all self-contained in the same folder. All the files should be in the folder, and it should run on the React system. 

Conversion estimation

This page is going to help debug the conversion rates stage. 
The way the system works is that there are six properties that we try and match every user with to the other users, and then we slowly remove a property until we get to only three properties. That becomes the forced scenario if it matches, otherwise it forces to a default rate. 
I want to create a page that shows all of this information in a very robust and easy-to-see way, and the way I'd like to do it is by creating a very clear hierarchy that is similar to this page /Users/joshuakaufman/untitled folder 3/orchestrator/dashboard/client/src/components/conversion_probability/AnalysisResultsHierarchy.jsx or /Users/joshuakaufman/untitled folder 3/orchestrator/dashboard/client/src/components/conversion_probability/RollupModal.jsx
I dont know exactly which one.
The idea is that I want to make it very clear to the viewer how everything is rolling up from what it's rolling up into. I want the hierarchy to be in a tree structure where it's very clear what is what. Whether or not there are enough in that segment to pass (i.e., there's at least 12), and if there are at least 12, what are the conversion rates that were assigned to that segment? I want to see every single segment's conversion rates, even the ones that had to default. If it had to default, it should be clear. The whole idea is that's kind of what I want to see. Please confirm you understand. I want you to think about the right way to present all this information. It's important to me that it's clear to the user, it's concise, it's easy to read, and it's easy to interpret. The whole point is this page is being used to debug, right? So we're going to be mapping all of the users in the database to this hierarchy so that it's clear to see and it should do it as best as it can using all the information that is in the DB. That's just taking the DB information and mapping it. And it can be as simple as literally going through every single user and then building the hierarchy just by going through every single user and taking their and bucketing them and taking their stats and all their stats should be exactly the same for all the same users and if they're not then there's a bug and that line should should have a red error or something or like and it should flag at the top of the screen when there should be some stats you know like at the top of how many of them are valid groupings how many of them are invalid groupings how many total groupings are there things like that just a handful of stats that are helpful to any viewer of the page please confirm you understand 

Value Estimates debug
 On this page, I would like to debug the value estimation stuff. 
 This page should be similar to the others, where it describes at the top all of the nuance that needs to be understood and clearly communicated to the users so they understand what to look for and where and what everything means. Then some statistics would be good in order to help clarify to the user any things that are relevant to this specific analysis here.

So there are a lot of things being set. Statistics there would be good too. And then I think that below that there should then be a filter that allows me to filter for whatever. And then below that there should be two examples, there should be three different sections or I guess two main sections. There should be the current status and the current value section and under it there should be two users that fit that criteria and it will show their information and the whole point is I want to be able to review each user and make sure that it makes sense.

So I'm going to see the event dates, I'm going to see their current stats, their current value, I'm going to see all the information regarding it, when the first event was, the credited date, all that stuff. All that should be there and it should be very clear to me. If you have any questions, please let me know.
