# MIXPANEL DASHBOARD ALIGNMENT PLAN
**Comprehensive Strategy for Perfect Mixpanel UI Alignment**

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Objective**: Align our dashboard's Mixpanel trials section and tooltip calculations with Mixpanel's native UI behavior to eliminate discrepancies.

**üéØ CRITICAL DISCOVERY - MIXPANEL LOGIC FOUND!**
Through systematic investigation, we discovered Mixpanel's exact counting logic:

```sql
Mixpanel Count = Trial Users + (Other Event Users ‚à© First Seen Users)
39 = 30 + 9
```

**Mixpanel UI Logic:**
1. Users with trial events in date range (30 users)
2. PLUS users with both: other events in date range AND first seen in date range (9 users)
3. Total: 39 users

---

## ‚úÖ PHASE 1: COMPLETE - MIXPANEL LOGIC DISCOVERED

### **Investigation Results**

#### **Systematic Testing Completed**
- ‚úÖ Tested all standard date fields: No matches to 39
- ‚úÖ Tested advanced hypotheses: Mathematical pattern found (30 + 9 = 39)
- ‚úÖ Identified exact logic: Intersection of other events + first seen users
- ‚úÖ Verified: `users_with_other_events ‚à© users_attributed_in_range = 39` ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

#### **Discovered Mixpanel Formula**
```sql
-- MIXPANEL UI LOGIC (DISCOVERED)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT u.distinct_id) as mixpanel_trials
FROM mixpanel_user u
WHERE u.abi_campaign_id = ?
  AND u.has_abi_attribution = TRUE
  AND (
      -- Condition 1: Users with trial events in date range
      EXISTS (
          SELECT 1 FROM mixpanel_event e 
          WHERE e.distinct_id = u.distinct_id 
          AND e.event_name = 'RC Trial started'
          AND DATE(e.event_time) BETWEEN ? AND ?
      )
      OR
      -- Condition 2: Users with other events AND first seen in range
      (
          EXISTS (
              SELECT 1 FROM mixpanel_event e 
              WHERE e.distinct_id = u.distinct_id 
              AND DATE(e.event_time) BETWEEN ? AND ?
          )
          AND DATE(u.first_seen) BETWEEN ? AND ?
      )
  )
```

## üöÄ PHASE 1 IMPLEMENTATION: UPDATE DASHBOARD LOGIC

### **Task 1.1: Update Main Dashboard Query** ‚úÖ READY TO IMPLEMENT

**Location**: `orchestrator/dashboard/services/analytics_query_service.py:1192`

**Current Code**:
```sql
COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN e.event_name = 'RC Trial started' 
                  AND DATE(e.event_time) BETWEEN ? AND ? 
                  THEN u.distinct_id END) as mixpanel_trials_started
```

**‚úÖ NEW CODE (EXACT MIXPANEL LOGIC)**:
```sql
COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN 
    -- Users with trial events in date range
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM mixpanel_event trial_e 
        WHERE trial_e.distinct_id = u.distinct_id 
        AND trial_e.event_name = 'RC Trial started'
        AND DATE(trial_e.event_time) BETWEEN ? AND ?
    )
    OR
    -- Users with other events AND first seen in range  
    (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM mixpanel_event other_e 
            WHERE other_e.distinct_id = u.distinct_id 
            AND DATE(other_e.event_time) BETWEEN ? AND ?
        )
        AND DATE(u.first_seen) BETWEEN ? AND ?
    )
    THEN u.distinct_id END) as mixpanel_trials_started
```

**Parameters**: `[start_date, end_date, start_date, end_date, start_date, end_date]`

### **Task 1.2: Update Chart Data Logic** ‚úÖ READY TO IMPLEMENT

**Location**: `orchestrator/dashboard/services/analytics_query_service.py:1789`

Apply the same logic to chart data for consistency.

### **Task 1.3: Validation Script** ‚úÖ READY TO IMPLEMENT

Create validation script to confirm the new logic produces exactly 39 for the test campaign.

---

## üéØ PHASE 2: TOOLTIP LOGIC ALIGNMENT

### **Phase 2 Implementation Plan**

#### **Task 2.1: Align Tooltip User Selection** ‚úÖ READY TO IMPLEMENT
**Objective**: Use the exact same 39 users from the discovered Mixpanel logic.

**New Tooltip Logic**:
```python
def get_user_details_for_tooltip(self, entity_type, entity_id, start_date, end_date):
    """
    PHASE 2: Use exact same user cohort as main dashboard
    """
    
    # Step 1: Get the exact users using DISCOVERED MIXPANEL LOGIC
    main_cohort_query = f"""
    SELECT DISTINCT u.distinct_id
    FROM mixpanel_user u
    LEFT JOIN mixpanel_event e ON u.distinct_id = e.distinct_id  
    WHERE u.{entity_field} = ?
      AND u.has_abi_attribution = TRUE
      AND (
          -- Users with trial events in date range
          EXISTS (
              SELECT 1 FROM mixpanel_event trial_e 
              WHERE trial_e.distinct_id = u.distinct_id 
              AND trial_e.event_name = 'RC Trial started'
              AND DATE(trial_e.event_time) BETWEEN ? AND ?
          )
          OR
          -- Users with other events AND first seen in range
          (
              EXISTS (
                  SELECT 1 FROM mixpanel_event other_e 
                  WHERE other_e.distinct_id = u.distinct_id 
                  AND DATE(other_e.event_time) BETWEEN ? AND ?
              )
              AND DATE(u.first_seen) BETWEEN ? AND ?
          )
      )
    """
    
    # Step 2: Get rates for these exact 39 users
    # Step 3: Apply segmenting methodology for missing rates
```

#### **Task 2.2: Implement Segmenting Methodology** 
For users without rate data, calculate using segment averages (unchanged from original plan).

#### **Task 2.3: Update Frontend Display**
Show exact user count that matches main dashboard (unchanged from original plan).

## üß™ IMMEDIATE VALIDATION STEPS

### **Step 1: Validate Discovery**
```python
def validate_discovered_logic():
    """Test the discovered logic produces exactly 39"""
    campaign_id = "120223331225260178"
    start_date = "2025-07-16" 
    end_date = "2025-07-29"
    
    # Test discovered logic
    result = execute_discovered_mixpanel_logic(campaign_id, start_date, end_date)
    assert result == 39, f"Expected 39, got {result}"
    
    print("‚úÖ VALIDATION PASSED: Discovered logic produces exactly 39!")
```

### **Step 2: Cross-Validate with Multiple Campaigns**
Test 3-5 other campaigns to ensure the logic is consistent.

### **Step 3: A/B Test Implementation**
- Deploy new logic alongside old logic
- Compare results for validation period
- Switch over once confirmed
