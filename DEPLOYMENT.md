# üöÄ Dashboard Deployment Guide

This guide shows you how to host your dashboard and restrict access to your team only.

## üîê Security Features Added
- **Basic HTTP Authentication**: Login required for all dashboard access
- **Environment-based credentials**: Secure password management
- **SSL/HTTPS support**: Encrypted communication
- **Security headers**: Protection against common attacks
- **IP whitelisting option**: Restrict access by IP address

## üìã Prerequisites
1. Your dashboard code
2. A domain name (optional but recommended)
3. SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt is free)

## üåü Quick Start (Railway - Recommended)

### 1. Prepare your repository
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy on Railway
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" ‚Üí "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. Railway will auto-detect your Python app

### 3. Configure environment variables
In Railway dashboard, go to Variables and add:
```
ADMIN_USERNAME=your-admin-username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-admin-password
TEAM_USERNAME=your-team-username
TEAM_PASSWORD=your-secure-team-password
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secure-secret-key-change-this
FLASK_ENV=production
```

### 4. Access your dashboard
- Railway will provide a URL like: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
- Visit the URL and enter your credentials

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

### 1. Build and run locally
```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t dashboard .

# Run with environment variables
docker run -d -p 5001:5001 \
  -e ADMIN_USERNAME=admin \
  -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=secure-password \
  -e TEAM_USERNAME=team \
  -e TEAM_PASSWORD=team-password \
  -e SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key \
  -e FLASK_ENV=production \
  --name dashboard \
  dashboard
```

### 2. Deploy with Docker Compose
```bash
# Edit docker-compose.yml with your credentials
# Then run:
docker-compose up -d
```

## üåê VPS Deployment (DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.)

### 1. Set up your server
```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sh get-docker.sh

# Install Docker Compose
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

### 2. Deploy your app
```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

# Edit docker-compose.yml with your credentials
nano docker-compose.yml

# Deploy
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Set up SSL with Let's Encrypt
```bash
# Install certbot
sudo apt install certbot

# Get SSL certificate
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d your-domain.com

# Copy certificates to your app directory
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem ./ssl/cert.pem
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem ./ssl/key.pem
sudo chown $USER:$USER ./ssl/*

# Restart with SSL
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

## üîí Additional Security Options

### Option 1: IP Whitelisting
Add your team's IP addresses to `nginx.conf`:
```nginx
# Uncomment and modify these lines in nginx.conf
allow 203.0.113.0/24;  # Your office IP range
allow 198.51.100.0/24; # Team member's home IP
deny all;
```

### Option 2: VPN Access
- Set up a VPN server (OpenVPN, WireGuard)
- Only allow dashboard access from VPN IPs
- Give team members VPN access

### Option 3: Google OAuth (Advanced)
Replace basic auth with Google OAuth:
```python
# Install: pip install flask-dance
from flask_dance.contrib.google import make_google_blueprint, google

# Add to your app
google_bp = make_google_blueprint(
    client_id="your-google-client-id",
    client_secret="your-google-client-secret",
    scope=["openid", "email", "profile"]
)
app.register_blueprint(google_bp, url_prefix="/login")
```

## üéØ Team Access Management

### Adding team members
1. **Basic Auth**: Add credentials to environment variables
2. **Google OAuth**: Add email addresses to allowed list
3. **IP Whitelist**: Add their IP addresses

### Managing passwords
```bash
# Generate secure passwords
openssl rand -base64 32

# Update environment variables in your hosting platform
# Restart the application
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common issues:
1. **Can't access dashboard**: Check firewall settings
2. **SSL errors**: Verify certificate paths
3. **Authentication fails**: Check environment variables
4. **App won't start**: Check logs with `docker-compose logs`

### Health check:
```bash
# Check if app is running
curl -u admin:password https://your-domain.com/api/analytics-pipeline/health
```

## üìä Monitoring

### Basic monitoring:
```bash
# Check container status
docker ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f dashboard

# Monitor resources
docker stats
```

### Advanced monitoring:
- Add [Uptime Robot](https://uptimerobot.com) for uptime monitoring
- Use [Sentry](https://sentry.io) for error tracking
- Set up [Grafana](https://grafana.com) for performance metrics

## üí∞ Cost Estimates

| Platform | Monthly Cost | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-------------|------|------|
| Railway | $5-20 | Easy setup, auto-scaling | Limited storage |
| Heroku | $7-25 | Popular, many addons | More expensive |
| DigitalOcean | $5-10 | Full control, cheap | More setup required |
| AWS/GCP | $5-50 | Enterprise features | Complex pricing |

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Choose your hosting platform
2. Set up authentication credentials
3. Configure SSL certificate
4. Test with your team
5. Set up monitoring
6. Create backup strategy
