User Lifecycle Sequence Analyzer

This script analyzes the mixpanel database to identify and count all unique
user lifecycle sequences for user-product pairings.

It differentiates between:
- RC cancellation with zero revenue (regular cancellation)  
- RC cancellation with negative revenue (refund)

Output: Aggregated counts of each unique lifecycle scenario
